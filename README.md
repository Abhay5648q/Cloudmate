# Cloudmate
This application allows users to enter any city name and instantly view the current temperature in Celsius, weather conditions, air quality index, sunrise and sunset timings, and a 5-day forecast. It features a responsive design and real-time data integration, highlighting my skills in API handling and user-focused UI development.
